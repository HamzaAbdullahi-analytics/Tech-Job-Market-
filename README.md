#  Tech Job Market Dashboard

This project visualizes current trends in the U.S. tech job market using real job postings data. I designed this dashboard to help job seekers, recruiters, and analysts explore hiring patterns, demand by city, job titles, skill frequency, and remote flexibility.

Built using Excel, SQL, IBM Cognos Analytics,  the dashboard focuses on interactive storytelling to turn raw numbers into real-world insight.
